# ChEESE-2P workshop on Computational Geodynamics

This repository contains material and scripts for the workshop _Computational Geodynamics: Modeling Geological Processes using European Flagship Codes_ at the Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz. The workshop is part of the [ChEESE2](https://cheese2.eu) consortium, and attendees will learn how to use the parallel codes [LaMEM](https://github.com/UniMainzGeo/LaMEM) and [pTatin](https://bitbucket.org/dmay/ptatin-total-dev.git) to perform 2D and 3D geodynamic simulations.

It is an in-person event, and will happen in room 01-114 of the NatFak (Geosciences) building of the Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz. The address is Johann-Joachim-Becher-Weg 21, 55128 Mainz. [Here](https://www.geosciences.uni-mainz.de/how-to-find-us/) are instructions on how to find us.

Slides of the workshop will be uploaded to a seafile folder, for which you received a link via email. In this repository, we collect exercises.

### Schedule
We have the following [schedule](Program-Computational-geodynamics-Modeling-Geological-Processes-using-European-Flagship-Codes.pdf) (note that we'll update links as the shortcourse progresses) 
1. Intro
2. Installing software and intro to julia
3. Intro to computational geodynamics
4. Geodynamic processes interactively 
5. Geodynamic models using LaMEM #1
6. Geodynamic models using LaMEM #2
   
### Required software
Participants will have to install the following software:
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) This is the most widely used coding environment worldwide and provides support for julia.
- [Julia](https://julialang.org) We will use julia to create model setups and run LaMEM. The easiest way to install julia these days is through [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup). Once you did that, you can install the `LaMEM`, `GeophysicalModelGenerator` and `Plots` packages.
- [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org) - This is a very powerful visualisation tool
- [FileZilla Client](https://filezilla-project.org) - This allows you to upload/download files from remote servers,
